**How to use this web app:**
1. Select your preferred product category.
2. Click **Run Agentic Analysis** to see recommendations & trending predictions.
3. The AI agents will think out loud before final results.

    **What This Means:**  
    These products are ranked using semantic AI embeddings, meaning the AI understands the *context* of your interest 
    and matches it to products that are not only in your chosen category but are also most relevant in meaning.  
    This approach mimics advanced AI recommendation systems used by top e-commerce companies to improve conversions.

**How These Recommendations Are Made:**  
Your results are ranked using **AI embeddings** that understand meaning, not just keywords.  
We combine:  1. What data is required (can be simple for demo, advanced in real use):

User-specific data (personalized):

Past purchased items

Past searched terms

Recently viewed products

Global / platform-wide data:

Products most bought in the last week/month

Items trending in your country or region

Average product ratings & reviews

2. How the AI ‚Äúunderstands meaning‚Äù:

Instead of matching just keywords (e.g., ‚Äúred shoes‚Äù), it converts both your interests and all product descriptions into AI embeddings (vector form).

These embeddings capture meaning, so if you liked ‚Äúrunning sneakers,‚Äù it might also suggest ‚Äúlightweight trainers‚Äù even if the words don‚Äôt match exactly.
1. **Your past purchase/search history** (simulated for this demo)  
2. **What‚Äôs trending globally** (latest popular products)  
3. **AI semantic matching** to find the most relevant items for you.  

This approach is inspired by techniques used by leading e-commerce companies to boost customer satisfaction and sales.
